[p]A collection of tweaks for Smart Cursor that will make it more helpful in a variety of situations.[/p]

[p]Some highlights:
- While you are digging a hellevator, it will heavily prioritize tiles that are aligned with it, so you don't have to eyeball the alignment after a long fall.
- When mining ores, smart cursor will proritize targeting tiles that are part of that ore vein.
- Pickaxes now very heavily prioritize targeting Crystal Shards, since breaking them is essentially free
- The Staff of Regrowth will target blooming herbs on planter boxes/clay pots, and both mature and blooming wild herbs.
- While holding rope, smart cursor will target the nearest placed rope for easy extension[/p]

[p]Built using LibSmartCursor, a smart cursor extension library I wrote for tModLoader[/p]
